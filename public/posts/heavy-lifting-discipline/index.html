<h1>Heavy Lifting: The Physics of Discipline</h1>

Dec 11, 2025


<br/><br/>
<p>Before I was optimizing backend latency, I was optimizing leverage.</p>
<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve competed in powerlifting, reaching national-level numbers and having the opportunity to compete against the best in the country.</p>
<p>At first glance, moving heavy circles seems to have nothing to do with writing software. But if you ask me, the overlap is massive.</p>
<p>Competing at a high level requires a specific type of discipline—one that doesn&rsquo;t just stay in the gym, but bleeds into every other aspect of your life. Surprisingly, lifting and coding share the same source code.</p>
<h3 id="1-progressive-overload">1. Progressive Overload</h3> <p>In lifting, you don&rsquo;t walk into the gym one day and say &ldquo;Today I&rsquo;ll squat 200kg&rdquo;. You add 2.5kg a week for years. You grind through months when the numbers don&rsquo;t move at all.</p>
<p>You define an objective, make a plan, and execute it.</p>
<p>This is identical to engineering. Every time you start a new project the mental model is the same. You break the massive problem (the 250kg deadlift) into manageable, iterative commits (the training block).</p>
<p>Both require patience and trust in the process, especially when the results aren&rsquo;t visible in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="2-failure-analysis">2. Failure Analysis</h3> <p>When you miss a lift at a competition, you don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;try harder&rdquo;. You analyze what happened, sometimes thinking about it for days.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Did my hips shoot up too fast?</em></li>
<li><em>Was my recovery poor?</em></li>
<li><em>Did I cut too much weight?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This is exactly how we handle incidents in production. We don&rsquo;t blame. We patch the weakness and re-test.</p>
<h3 id="3-data-over-feelings">3. Data Over Feelings</h3> <p>A loaded barbell doesn&rsquo;t care how you feel. It weighs what it weighs.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can&rsquo;t trust that your system is &ldquo;optimized&rdquo; just because the code looks clean until it&rsquo;s in production and the metrics confirm it.</p>
<p>My background in sport taught me to look at the metrics first and leave the ego at the door.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Even though I haven&rsquo;t competed in almost 2 years, the discipline remains.</p>
<p>Whether I am training or coding, the satisfaction comes from the same place: tangible, measurable progress.</p>
