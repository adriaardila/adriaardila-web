Before I was optimizing backend latency, I was optimizing leverage.

For years, I've competed in powerlifting, reaching national-level numbers and having the opportunity to compete against the best in the country.

At first glance, moving heavy circles seems to have nothing to do with writing software. But if you ask me, the overlap is massive.

Competing at a high level requires a specific type of discipline—one that doesn't just stay in the gym, but bleeds into every other aspect of your life. Surprisingly, lifting and coding share the same source code.

### 1. Progressive Overload
In lifting, you don't walk into the gym one day and say "Today I'll squat 200kg". You add 2.5kg a week for years. You grind through months when the numbers don't move at all.

You define an objective, make a plan, and execute it.

This is identical to engineering. Every time you start a new project the mental model is the same. You break the massive problem (the 250kg deadlift) into manageable, iterative commits (the training block).

Both require patience and trust in the process, especially when the results aren't visible in the short term.

### 2. Failure Analysis
When you miss a lift at a competition, you don't just "try harder". You analyze what happened, sometimes thinking about it for days.
* *Did my hips shoot up too fast?*
* *Was my recovery poor?*
* *Did I cut too much weight?*

This is exactly how we handle incidents in production. We don't blame. We patch the weakness and re-test.

### 3. Data Over Feelings
A loaded barbell doesn't care how you feel. It weighs what it weighs.

Similarly, you can't trust that your system is "optimized" just because the code looks clean until it's in production and the metrics confirm it.

My background in sport taught me to look at the metrics first and leave the ego at the door.

### Conclusion
Even though I haven't competed in almost 2 years, the discipline remains. 

Whether I am training or coding, the satisfaction comes from the same place: tangible, measurable progress.
